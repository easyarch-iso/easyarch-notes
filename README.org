* EasyArch Notes
  This document contains notes for building, testing and running EasyArch ISO.

** Update system before running setup.sh
   Before running =setup.sh= script, the host system must be updated to the latest state.
   Meaning all the software and tools and libraries must be up-to-date. The main reason is
   that if there are updates pending and the =setup.sh= is used to build packages from aur
   or even the installer itself, it is possible that will be broken due to dependency
   version mismatch. As a result, the installer may not run at all, or the other aur packages
   built during =setup.sh= execution, may not run at all in the live system. So it is
   essential to check for updates and if there are updates, the host system must be updated.

** Add host-to-guest readonly share in virt-manager
   After booting into the live system, a readonly host-to-guest folder share can be created
   in virt-manager. To do so -
   1. First create a folder in the host which will be shared (i.e VMShared).
   2. Also create a filesystem hardware in virt-manager like the following images -
      [[images/virt-manager_filesystem_device.png]]
      [[images/vmshared_in_virt-manager.jpg]]
   3. Then boot up the live system, run the following command to mount the readonly shared
      folder - 
      #+BEGIN_SRC shell
        sudo mount -t 9p -o trans=virtio /VMShared VMShared
      #+END_SRC
